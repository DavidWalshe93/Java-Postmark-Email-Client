# Java Postmark Email Client

This project was completed as part of my "Communication Networks" module. 

It uses the POSTMARK API to send transactional emails using the HTTP protocol rather then the SMTP protocol. 

I was able to create a GUI application to simulate a email client, select/remove people from a mailing list and send emails according to the user input. 

Using webhooks I was able to create a "unsubscribe me" service for a recipient of an email to unsubscribe from a mailing list. This was done by producing Java code to monitor a webhook for any reply emails with an OPT-OUT signature. 

This project took 2 weeks to complete.
